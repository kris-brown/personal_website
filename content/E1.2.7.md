 - Prove that the graph $\Gamma_f$ of $A \xrightarrow{f} B$ is isomorphic to <i>A</i>

***
 - The graph has all pairs $\in A \times B$ s.t. $(a,f(a))$
 - We need to show that  $\Gamma_f \xrightarrow{\pi_A} A$ is a bijection
 - It is injective because functions cannot assign multiple values of <i>B</i> to a single <i>A</i>, thus there is no more than one pair for each value of <i>A</i>
 - It is surjective because functions assign a value for each element of <i>A</i>
