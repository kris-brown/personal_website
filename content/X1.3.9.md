 - Like the slice categories, we now consider a category derived from an existing category and <i>two</i> of its objects. Let $\mathcal{C}_{A,B}$ be defined by essentially the same procedure.
   - Objects are pairs of morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$ to <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, and morphisms (between, say, $(f_1,g_1)$ and $(f_2,g_2)$ are diagrams like the following that commute:  $\begin{tikzcd} & & A \\ Z_1 \arrow[r, "\sigma"] \arrow[rru, "f_1", bend left] \arrow[rrd, "g_1"', bend right] & Z_2 \arrow[ru, "f_2"] \arrow[rd, "g_2"] &   \\ & & B\end{tikzcd}$ 
   - Flipping the arrows gives an analogous category related to the coslice category.
