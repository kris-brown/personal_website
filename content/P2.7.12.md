 - Let <i>H</i> be a normal subgroup of <i>G</i>. For every group homomorphism $G \xrightarrow{\phi}G'$ such that $H \subseteq ker(\phi)$ there exists a unique group homomorphism $G/H \xrightarrow{\tilde{\phi}}G'$ such that the following diagram commutes.
 - $\begin{tikzcd}G \arrow[rr, "\phi"] \arrow[rd, "\pi"'] & & G' \\ & G/H \arrow[ru, "\tilde{\phi}"', dashed] & \end{tikzcd}$

***
 - The definition of $\tilde\phi$ is uniquely forced for each coset <i>gH</i> to make the diagram commute (namely: $\tilde\phi(gH)\mapsto \phi(g)$)
 - This is well-defined, i.e. independent of representative. Suppose some other $g' = gh \in gH$ :
 -  $\tilde\phi(gH)=\tilde\phi(g)=\tilde\phi(g'h)=\tilde\phi(g')\tilde\phi(h)=\tilde\phi(g')e_H=\tilde\phi(g')=\tilde\phi(g'H)$
 - This is also a homomorphism: $\tilde\phi(gH)\tilde\phi(g'H)=\phi(g)\phi(g')=\phi(gg')=\tilde\phi(gg'H)=\tilde\phi(gH\cdot g'H)$
