This code is for both generating a website as well as taking math notes (taken in an org-mode file) and transforming them into web pages, ideally in the style of [Project Crazy Project](https://web.archive.org/web/20140327002205/http://crazyproject.wordpress.com/aadf/#df-1).

The goal of sharing my solutions to textbook problems online is not only to help others but also to get feedback! Self-studying topics like math is difficult, and there are likely many errors to be found. My hope is that the comment feature would be in part used for this.

Sadly I'm stuck with using lts-8.13 for Haskell because I want to use GHC-mod for linting in Atom.

The project is generated by running `stack exec site rebuild; stack exec site deploy`.

To do:
- migrate my Python-based infrastructure for converting the org-mode notes into Anki flashcards and do it here in Haskell.
