  <h3> Knowledge representation and data integration </h3>

  <u>Declarative specification of databases</u> <br>
  Scientists modeling complicated phenomena don't use explicit (formally-specified) models.
  This is pragmatic, given current available open-source tools, but informal reasoning ulimately
  leads to serious challenges in communicating scientific results clearly and sharing data.
  A relational database backend is important for a scalable modeling tool,
  but a SQL-less interface is also crucial: the complexity of managing database implementation details
  quickly becomes unmanagable and unextensible as the model complexity increases. I develop
  a Python EDSL to help scientists generate relational databases from a natural declaration
  of scientific facts and to naturally query and publicly communicate their knowledge base. <br></br>

  <a href="https://github.com/kris-brown/cql_data_integration"><u>Heterogenous data integration, using Category Theory</u></a><br>
  There is little standardization in how data is to be represented and stored in many scientific fields.
  However, the varying schemas of different researchers contain
  significant overlap in information, and for data-driven fields it is especially
  beneficial to be able to freely switch from one frame of reference to another.
  <a href="http://catinf.com/"> Algebraic Query Language</a>, a tool recently developed by
  Categorical Informatics, allows for specification of data migration and integration
  in a declarative and clean process. I aim to show the utility of this approach
  in the field of computational chemistry, in collaboration with <a href="http://wisnesky.net/">Ryan Wisnesky</a>.<br><br>

  <h3>Machine learning applied to computational chemistry</h3>

  <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~ksb/CS230.png"><u>A Chemical Analog to the Convolution Operation</u></a> <br>
  Along with <a href="https://suncat.stanford.edu/people/brian-andrew-rohr">Brian
    Rohr</a> and <a href="https://suncat.stanford.edu/people/michael-statt">Michael
    Statt</a>, I develop models which quickly compute
  high-level properties of atomic systems from cheap descriptors by leveraging
  recent advances in ML (e.g. graph-convolutional and message-passing networks).
  The link goes to our poster which was awarded 1st place in Andrew Ng's
  <a href="http://cs230.stanford.edu/">CS 230: Deep Learning</a> course (Winter 2018).<br><br>

  <a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~vossj/project/xc-functionals/"><u>Development of functionals for Density Functional Theory</u></a> <br>
  Simulation of chemical reactions using first-principles techniques requires a
  theoretical framework that is able to describe a wide range of electronic interactions.
  Under the direction of <a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~vossj/">Johannes
    Voss</a>, I develop new meta exchange-correlation functionals with a semi-empirical approach,
  fitting the functional form against higher level of theory and experimental benchmark data.
  By using Bayesian statistics, we enable uncertainty estimation of the computed reaction energies. <br><br>

  <h3> Other </h3>

  <a href="https://github.com/kris-brown/graphatoms"><u>Multigraph representations of atomic structures</u></a> <br>
  Reasoning about complicated phenomena occurring at electrochemical interfaces
  from simulation data is a challenging process that often requires the scientist
  to "look" at the chemical structures to get some intuition about what is going
  on. This becomes unreasonable as the scale of data increases. Converting atomic
  structures into multigraphs (atoms = nodes, bonds = edges), we can automatically
  give high-level structure to otherwise unintelligible data and draw scientifically
  interesting conclusions about large datasets.<br><br>

  <a href="https://github.com/kris-brown/kinetics/tree/ksb_projects"><u>Analytic approaches to chemical kinetics</u></a> <br>
  Solving for the steady state of kinetics problems modeling interface science can
  suffer from numerical instability when solved with traditional methods, but
  applying Groebner bases to analytically solve these systems offers new alternatives.
